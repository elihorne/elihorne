As with most years, I started 2020 with the best intentions. Read more, work out often, drink less. Then COVID came, and that all went out of the window. By March, I was sheltering-in-place, trying to juggle a full-time job while being a full-time parent to a 6-month old toddler. This year changed how I perceived time, making some days feel like weeks, while months just slipped past un-measured. Thankfully, it’s officially over.

This is the first issue of what I hope will become a (semi) weekly habit in 2021 - a reflection on recent time past, and the things that stood out. Sometimes it will be about the week, other times a month, quarter or year. You’ll just have to stay tuned.

## TV and Movies

Being cooped up at home meant a lot of screen time. Despite not being able to produce new shows, Netflix kept releasing a steady drip of their back catalog, and it kept this addict sated. We also subscribed to Hulu, Apple TV, HBO Max, and Quibi (JK).

Here are some of the highlights

- ♟️ Queen’s Gambit. Anya Taylor-Joy made chess, alcoholism and widely-spaced eyeballs oddly fascinating.

- 🔥 Little Fires Everywhere. Karen got her own show, played by Reese Witherspoon.

- 😄 Ted Lasso. Saccharine and simple, yet somehow exactly what I needed. An escape to a world where nice people succeed and things work out alright.

- 💩 Schitt’s Creek. It took me until the end of the show to realize that it’s secretely about a reality where hate doesn’t exist. Tears and laughter.

- 👴 The Presidential Debates. I didn’t like it. Actually, I hated it. But I watched all of them. It didn’t make me feel smarter or more hopeful. 1/10 would not do again.

## Books

I had a goal of reading 20 books in 2020, and I only made it through 10. Here are some stand-outs.

- 🎈Washington Black (fiction). A lush travelogue telling the story of a young slave from the Barbados who finds freedom, dignity and self-invention against all odds.

- 💉 Dreamland (non-fiction). How Purdue got the suburbs got hooked on Oxycontin, and how black tar heroin made it’s way from dusty roads in rural Mexico to main street America.

- 💭 Atomic Habits (productivity). A detailed guide to building good habits and breaking bad ones.

## Podcasts

I spent a lot of time pushing a stroller around McCarren park, trying to create space at home for Liz to focus and get work done. I usually had podcasts playing through the airpods.

- 📰 The Daily. I started the year listening… daily, but eventually it got too depressing and I had to take a break. Lately I’ve resumed the habit. Mikey Barbaro’s vocal ticks sometimes irk me, but I think it’s some of the best audio journalism out there.

- 📍 Pivot with Kara Swisher and Scott Galloway. There’s something fun about the dynamic between Kara, a grizzled tech reporter, and Scott, a boisterous NYU professor of business. Highly relevant if you work in tech, are interested in business strategy, and aren’t drinking the “tech will save the world” kool-aid.

- 💃 Sway. Kara Swisher’s new NYT Opinion podcast where she interviews some of the heaviest hitters of the moment, and holds their feet to the fire.

Honorable mention (although not a regular listen)

- 😆 Smartless. Actors Jason Bateman, Sean Hayes and Will Arnett take turns bringing on a surprise guest.

## Apps

Beyond streaming apps, this year brought apps to replace the gym, apps to help you work from home, and apps to distract you from the burning dumpster fire out the window.

- 💸 Copilot. The best budgeting/finance app I’ve used in some time. It instantly replaced Mint in terms of utility and visibility. It costs money, but its worth it.

- 📖 Notion. I got over my aversion to Notion’s visual styling, and embraced the “build your own productivity tool” movement. Honestly, it’s pretty great. It quickly replaced my pen and paper tracking system that I’ve used for a couple years now.

- 🎨 Figma. This web-based Sketch killer just keeps getting better. It’s great for work, and totally free for personal use. It will change the next generation of product designers who never knew the pain of Adobe/InVision/etc.

- 🎮 Stadia. In all truth, I didn’t have much time to play video games, but I picked up a Stadia controller to check out Cyberpunk 2077. It blows me away that you can stream a flagship 4k video game to any screen in your house, without any of the console costs or hassle (updates, start-up times, etc). It just works.
