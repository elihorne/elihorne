## Problem

Creators often come to Kickstarter with a creative idea, but no
limited experience creating budgets and anticipating fulfillment
costs. Lack of planning in this area can make or break a project
and is one of the top reported concerns from backers.

## Solution

The team leveraged a Google Sheets template based on
calculations from experienced creators and made it available to
everyone. Once completed, an interactive visualization was
generated which could be published on the project page to help
Backers understand how funds were being allocated.

## Impact

- 40% of creators use the feature
- 5% of creators publish the visualization
- Significant press coverage
