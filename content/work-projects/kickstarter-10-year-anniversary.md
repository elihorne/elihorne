## Problem

After defining the crowdfunding space in 2009, Kickstarter entered a period of dormancy, and its beloved and vibrant brand had become muted and flat. My tenure overlapped with Kickstarter's 10th birthday, and we saw an opportunity to remindthe world who we were.

## Solution

We celebrated with a company-wide effort. Product worked closely with Brand to infuse Kickstarter with new colors, typography, illustrations, and interactive components."

## Impact

- 144k visitors (goal was 30k)
- 18% engagement rate (goal was 10%)
- $2.1M average daily backings (goal was $1.7M)
