### Swinging the pendulum towards mobile

Our web experience was the flagship platform, but mobile usage was
growing rapidly - especially in emerging markets.

The mobile apps supported significantly fewer features than the web
versions, and the experience was randomly different between iOS and
Android. You could edit a table on Android, but not add one. You
could view hightlighted text on iOS but not edit it.

I designed a palette system for Docs that accomodated the incoming
features, and worked with design leads on the other editors to make
sure we were consistent.

## Utility

### Making mobile creation faster

Styling text and working with lists in the mobile editor was
harder than it needed to be, and we had the data to prove it.

<div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 mx-auto max-w-3xl">
	<div class="col">
		<img
		class="demo"
		src="/work/google/formatting-stats-fade.png"
		/>
	</div>
	<div class="col mx-auto max-w-2xl">
		<div class="col-inline">
		<p>
			I gathered stats on the top 10% formatting actions on desktop
			and compared them to mobile. I then designed a contextual tool
			strip that appeared above the on-screen keyboard, making
			popular actions much faster to access.
		</p>
		<p>
			The toolbar was particularly useful for surfacing secondary
			options like indentation when inside of a list.
		</p>
		<p>
			After launch, documents containing rich formatting increased
			significantly.
		</p>
		</div>
	</div>
</div>

<div class="my-8 mx-auto max-w-2xl">
	<h3 class="text-xl mt-4">Making conversations easier</h3>
	<div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-8">
	<div class="col">
		<div class="col-inline">
		<p>
			Commenting was very powerful feature, but usage was
			dissapointlingly low. I suspected it was because discovery and
			access to the feature was buried.
		</p>
		<p>
			I designed this feature which appeared near the margin when
			you hovered in that area, or selected content on the canvas.
		</p>
		<p>After launch, comment usage went up significantly.</p>

## Experimentation

### Pushing on the boundaries of productivity

<div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2">
<div class="col">
	<p>
	I led several initiatives to explore what productivity tools
	might look like in the future - faster, smarter, better.
	</p>
	<p>
	While these features didn't launch in this exact format, they
	influenced other "assistive" initiatives at Google.
	</p>
