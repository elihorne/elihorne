### Optimize the hiring process

As I began to focus on hiring designers to support the company's
various parallel initiatives, I noticed a lot of inefficiencies in
the hiring process. Specifically, we didn't have confidence that a
candidate's portfolio represented the quality of work they would
bring to Kickstarter, and candidates were often brought back for
multiple rounds because the interviewers couldn't agree if that
person was the right fit for the role. Interviews seemed to get
stuck perpetually at the "on-site" stage.

</ol>
</div>
          
One of the benefits of my experience at Google is that I've
conducted <em>a lot</em> of interviews. I was able to cherry-pick
parts that made sense for Kickstarter and streamline the process so
that we could hire a significant number of people in a minimal
amount of time. Here are some of the changes I introduced:
          
<ul class="list-disc list-inside">
<li class="py-2">
	<strong>At-home exercise.</strong> While some consider this
	controversial, there's no better way that I know of to filter for
	a person's individual abilities against a portfolio where a larger
	team is usually involved.
</li>
<li class="py-2">
	<strong>Group interview panel.</strong> On-site interviews begin
	with a group panel, where the candidate walks through their
	at-home exercise and portfolio case studies. This lets the panel
	start with the same first impression, and saves candidates from
	having to answer the same repetitive questions about their
	presentation in subsequent 1:1's.
</li>
<li class="py-2">
	<strong>Interviewer lenses.</strong> Representatives from across
	the product function (PM, Design, Engineering) participate in the
	interview, and designers represent the many facets of the design
	process. Rather than have 3 designers do the same shallow
	portfolio review, we dive deep into areas of responsibility like
	"problem solving", "core skills", and "strategic thinking."
</li>
</ul>
<div class="hiring-wizard steps-4 mt-12 my-8 mx-auto max-w-4xl"
>
<ol>
	<li>
	<span class="step active">1</span>
	<p>Phone screen</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<span class="step active">2</span>
	<p>At-home exercise</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<span class="step active">3</span>
	<p>On-site panel</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<span class="step active">4</span>
	<p>Offer</p>
	</li>
</ol>
</div>
          
At its largest, I scaled my team to 8 product designers, 1 UX
writer, and a translation consultant. This group was responsible for
all experiences across Web, iOS, and Android, in all markets. We
also led initiatives related to accessibility and
internationalization.
          
### Blaze a clear growth path
          
I believe that unspoken expectations are premeditated resentments.
Throughout my career, I've done my best work when I've known what
was expected of me, and how my contributions would be measured.
          
I've observed a pattern in the industry that I call "title bloat,"
where people are called "senior" or "director" without the requisite
skills and experience. When a role's expectations aren't clear, it
can make hiring and promotions extremely murky and qualitative, when
it should be anything but.
          
I created a "skills matrix" which provided clear expectations for
each level of seniority on my team. This document was used during
the hiring process to calibrate level, as well as during the
bi-annual review process for existing team members to set goals and
understand their progress towards their next career milestone.

	<span class="col-header">Designer</span>
	<span class="col-header">Senior Designer</span>
	<span class="col-header last">Staff Designer</span>

	<span><span class="redact"></span></span>
	<span><span class="redact"></span></span>
	<span><span class="redact"></span></span>
</div>

The skills matrix was so well received that it was later adopted by
the Engineering and Product Management organizations.

## Product process and culture

> I established several core practices that I believe are essential to

### Integrate a consistent design critique process

Every design project at Kickstarter began and ended with a critique.
Designers scheduled as many critiques as they found useful, but at a
minimum, we expected to see work at an early, unrefined stage, which
we called "Studio", and again before it went into development, which
we called "Review".

<div class="design-critique max-w-4xl mx-auto text-sm"
>
	<div class="grid grid-cols-3">
		<div class="stage">Early</div>
		<div class="stage">Mid</div>
		<div class="stage">Late</div>
		<div class="early">
			<div class="crit">
				<h5>Studio</h5>
				<p>Open-ended, divergent ideation</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="empty mid"></div>
		<div class="empty late"></div>
		<div class="empty early"></div>
		<div class="mid">
			<div class="crit">
				<h5>General</h5>
				<p>Iterative feedback, validation</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="empty late"></div>
		<div class="empty early last"></div>
		<div class="empty mid last"></div>
		<div class="late last">
			<div class="crit">
				<h5>Review</h5>
				<p>Pre-implementation, fit and finish</p>
			</div>
		</div>
	</div>
</div>
         
There were no preset requirements in terms of what they needed to
present. The critiques existed to be of value to the designer, not
to the stakeholders. By default, the entire design team was invited
to every session, as well as:

<ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
<li>A design systems representative</li>
<li>A senior PM</li>
<li>A system integrity representative</li>
<li>A UX writer</li>
<li>Our in-house legal counsel</li>
</ul>
          
The presence of a legal stakeholder might seem controversial,
especially during the early and most vulnerable stages of the design
process, but we were very lucky to have a product-minded legal team
who helped us anticipate potential issues and explore creative
solutions far earlier in the process than if we had waited to
include them.

This critique process had several benefits. It ensured that a
representative sample of the company was aware of on-going design
work at essential milestones. It also taught and nurtured a culture
of being able to give and receive feedback.

### Reboot design systems and tooling

I put in place a design systems team (comprised of design, copy, and
engineering stakeholders) which met regularly to discuss existing
patterns, proposed changes to the system, and upcoming trends worth
considering. They evaluated patterns for consistency with the larger
system as well as accessibility and internationalization concerns.

<p>
The world of design systems and related tooling moves quickly, and
it's important to find a balance between continuing to invest in and
maintain your existing infrastructure, and knowing when a new
approach might introduce increased efficiency and productivity.
</p>

<p>
When I joined Kickstarter, the design team was using a mixture of
Sketch and Dropbox. I'm a big believer in the right tool for the job
- Dropbox was falling short of our needs when it came to
collaboration and knowing with certainty that you were working on
the latest version of a design.
</p>
<p>
We explored Sketch-specific design management tools like Abstract
and InVision before realizing that we needed to re-evaluate our
entire stack. As a team, we made extensive use of Google's G Suite
for writing and communication, and we loved the real-time
collaboration, built-in versioning, and instant sharing features.
The clear design equivalent was (then) new-comer "Figma". I worked
with my team to coordinate a trial period where we ran both tools
side by side, and ensured that our peers in Engineering Product
Management could still collaborate with us. It was a clear winner.
We made the switch and haven't looked back.
</p>
<p>
Figma allows us to have shared libraries of patterns, components,
and styles that are always in sync and up-to-date. It also allowed
us to reduce our budget costs by eliminating 3 other software
licenses (Sketch, Abstract, and InVision.)
</p>

### Make user research a core practice

<div class="grid grid-cols-1 gap-6 max-w-2xl mx-auto md:grid-cols-6">
<div class="col-span-4">
	<p>
	When I arrived at Kickstarter, there was an interest in user
	research, but the organization lacked systems and processes
	which created a vacuum where anecdotal data samples and personal
	experiences were used to shape product decisions.
	</p>
	<p>
	I created a system that passively recruited participants -
	<a class="kickstarter" href="https://kickstarter.com/research"
		>kickstarter.com/research</a
	>, allowed filtering by screener criteria, facilitated
	scheduling, and enabled participant compensation. This system
	made it incredibly easy to include user research as part of the
	design process.
	</p>
	<p>
	After a couple of months, we went from having zero qualified
	participants to more than 500k in the research pool. We saw
	significant adoption of the user research practice - not only
	with the design team but also within product management.
	</p>
	<p>
	User research is now a key component of almost every project at
	Kickstarter. We use it for initial validation of design
	explorations, conduct usability, and accessibility testing
	during development, and follow up with users after release to
	measure success and impact.
	</p>
	<p>
	Access to this resource demonstrated the value to the
	organization, and we have since hired two full-time user
	researchers to expand the program.
	</p>
