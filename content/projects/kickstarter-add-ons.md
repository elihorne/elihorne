## Problem

While rewards provide an excellent way for Creators to thank
Backers for their support, some projects had a level of
complexity that our existing feature set didn't meet. The
ability to provide "add-ons", or optional rewards, was one of
the top user requests.

## Solution

After user research and a private beta period, we released our
take on add-ons across all platforms, taking into account the
needs of both creators and backers, and it saw warm reception
and immediate adoption.

## Impact

- 8.5% increase to average pledge amount
- 17% increase to total revenue
- 22% of pledges included add-ons (goal was 15%)
