          <p>
            As I began to focus on hiring designers to support the company's
            various parallel initiatives, I noticed a lot of inefficiencies in
            the hiring process. Specifically, we didn't have confidence that a
            candidate's portfolio represented the quality of work they would
            bring to Kickstarter, and candidates were often brought back for
            multiple rounds because the interviewers couldn't agree if that
            person was the right fit for the role. Interviews seemed to get
            stuck perpetually at the "on-site" stage.

            One of the benefits of my experience at Google is that I've
            conducted <em>a lot</em> of interviews. I was able to cherry-pick
            parts that made sense for Kickstarter and streamline the process so
            that we could hire a significant number of people in a minimal
            amount of time. Here are some of the changes I introduced:
          </p>
          <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
            <li class="py-2">
              <strong>At-home exercise.</strong> While some consider this
              controversial, there's no better way that I know of to filter for
              a person's individual abilities against a portfolio where a larger
              team is usually involved.
            </li>
            <li class="py-2">
              <strong>Group interview panel.</strong> On-site interviews begin
              with a group panel, where the candidate walks through their
              at-home exercise and portfolio case studies. This lets the panel
              start with the same first impression, and saves candidates from
              having to answer the same repetitive questions about their
              presentation in subsequent 1:1's.
            </li>
            <li class="py-2">
              <strong>Interviewer lenses.</strong> Representatives from across
              the product function (PM, Design, Engineering) participate in the
              interview, and designers represent the many facets of the design
              process. Rather than have 3 designers do the same shallow
              portfolio review, we dive deep into areas of responsibility like
              "problem solving", "core skills", and "strategic thinking."

            At its largest, I scaled my team to 8 product designers, 1 UX
            writer, and a translation consultant. This group was responsible for
            all experiences across Web, iOS, and Android, in all markets. We
            also led initiatives related to accessibility and
            internationalization.

          <h3 class="text-xl mt-4">Blaze a clear growth path</h3>
          <p>
            I believe that unspoken expectations are premeditated resentments.
            Throughout my career, I've done my best work when I've known what
            was expected of me, and how my contributions would be measured.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've observed a pattern in the industry that I call "title bloat,"
            where people are called "senior" or "director" without the requisite
            skills and experience. When a role's expectations aren't clear, it
            can make hiring and promotions extremely murky and qualitative, when
            it should be anything but.
          </p>
          <p>
            I created a "skills matrix" which provided clear expectations for
            each level of seniority on my team. This document was used during
            the hiring process to calibrate level, as well as during the
            bi-annual review process for existing team members to set goals and
            understand their progress towards their next career milestone.

            Designers scheduled as many critiques as they found useful, but at a
            minimum, we expected to see work at an early, unrefined stage, which
            we called "Studio", and again before it went into development, which

            There were no preset requirements in terms of what they needed to
            present. The critiques existed to be of value to the designer, not
            to the stakeholders. By default, the entire design team was invited
            to every session, as well as:
          </p>
          <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
            <li>A design systems representative</li>
            <li>A senior PM</li>
            <li>A system integrity representative</li>
            <li>A UX writer</li>
            <li>Our in-house legal counsel</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The presence of a legal stakeholder might seem controversial,
            especially during the early and most vulnerable stages of the design
            process, but we were very lucky to have a product-minded legal team
            who helped us anticipate potential issues and explore creative
            solutions far earlier in the process than if we had waited to
            include them.
          </p>
          <p>
            This critique process had several benefits. It ensured that a
            representative sample of the company was aware of on-going design
            work at essential milestones. It also taught and nurtured a culture
            of being able to give and receive feedback.
          </p>

          <h3 class="text-xl mt-4">Reboot design systems and tooling</h3>
          <p>
            I put in place a design systems team (comprised of design, copy, and
            engineering stakeholders) which met regularly to discuss existing
            patterns, proposed changes to the system, and upcoming trends worth
            considering. They evaluated patterns for consistency with the larger
            system as well as accessibility and internationalization concerns.

          <p>
            The world of design systems and related tooling moves quickly, and
            it's important to find a balance between continuing to invest in and
            maintain your existing infrastructure, and knowing when a new
            approach might introduce increased efficiency and productivity.
          </p>

          <p>
            When I joined Kickstarter, the design team was using a mixture of
            Sketch and Dropbox. I'm a big believer in the right tool for the job
            - Dropbox was falling short of our needs when it came to
            collaboration and knowing with certainty that you were working on
            the latest version of a design.
          </p>
          <p>
            We explored Sketch-specific design management tools like Abstract
            and InVision before realizing that we needed to re-evaluate our
            entire stack. As a team, we made extensive use of Google's G Suite
            for writing and communication, and we loved the real-time
            collaboration, built-in versioning, and instant sharing features.
            The clear design equivalent was (then) new-comer "Figma". I worked
            with my team to coordinate a trial period where we ran both tools
            side by side, and ensured that our peers in Engineering Product
            Management could still collaborate with us. It was a clear winner.
            We made the switch and haven't looked back.
          </p>
          <p>
            Figma allows us to have shared libraries of patterns, components,
            and styles that are always in sync and up-to-date. It also allowed
            us to reduce our budget costs by eliminating 3 other software
            licenses (Sketch, Abstract, and InVision.)

          <h3 class="text-xl mt-10">Make user research a core practice</h3>

                When I arrived at Kickstarter, there was an interest in user
                research, but the organization lacked systems and processes
                which created a vacuum where anecdotal data samples and personal
                experiences were used to shape product decisions.
              </p>
              <p>
                I created a system that passively recruited participants -
                <a class="kickstarter" href="https://kickstarter.com/research"
                  >kickstarter.com/research</a
                >, allowed filtering by screener criteria, facilitated
                scheduling, and enabled participant compensation. This system
                made it incredibly easy to include user research as part of the
                design process.
              </p>
              <p>
                After a couple of months, we went from having zero qualified
                participants to more than 500k in the research pool. We saw
                significant adoption of the user research practice - not only
                with the design team but also within product management.

                User research is now a key component of almost every project at
                Kickstarter. We use it for initial validation of design
                explorations, conduct usability, and accessibility testing
                during development, and follow up with users after release to
                measure success and impact.
              </p>

                Access to this resource demonstrated the value to the
                organization, and we have since hired two full-time user
                researchers to expand the program.

                complexity that our existing feature set didn't meet. The
                ability to provide "add-ons", or optional rewards, was one of

                Creators often come to Kickstarter with a creative idea, but no
                limited experience creating budgets and anticipating fulfillment
                costs. Lack of planning in this area can make or break a project
                and is one of the top reported concerns from backers.

                generated which could be published on the project page to help
                Backers understand how funds were being allocated.

                After defining the crowdfunding space in 2009, Kickstarter
                entered a period of dormancy, and its beloved and vibrant brand
                had become muted and flat. My tenure overlapped with
                Kickstarter's 10th birthday, and we saw an opportunity to remind
                the world who we were.
