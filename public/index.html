              <p>Scripps Networks is a lifestyle media company, responsible for many popular brands including HGTV and the Food Network.</p>
              <p>I was tasked with creating a design system that could be shared between properties. Modular components like dropdown headers and carousels could be implemented quickly, and easily skinned.</p>

              <h3 class="heading">Up First: HGTV</h3>
              <h4 class="sub-heading">Getting the house in order</h4>
              <p>HGTV was the first property that used the new design system. We knew that each top level category (decorating, home improvement, etc) had several important child categories and we wanted to provide "single click" access.</p>
              <p>We ended up with something we called "super dropdowns" which were exposed on hover. This design had an added benefit of being highly accessible and improving search engine optimization.</p>

              <h4 class="sub-heading">Now we are cooking</h4>
              <p>Once we ironed out the wrinkles with HGTV, the first skinning candidate was Food Network.</p>
              <p>You can see the exact same "super dropdown" component in use, and the surrounding components locked to the same grid.</p>

                <p>During my time on the G Suite team, I was design lead for Docs, Sheets and Forms. I also contributed features to Slides, and led experimental initiatives.</p>
                <p>The work below shows some highlights. More work is available upon request.

                <h4 class="sub-heading">Swinging the pendulum towards mobile</h4>
                <p>Our web experience was the flagship platform, but mobile usage was growing rapidly - especially in emerging markets.</p>
                <p>The mobile apps supported significantly fewer features than the web versions, and the experience was randomly different
                  between iOS and Android. You could edit a table on Android, but not add one. You could view hightlighted text on iOS but not edit it.</p>

                <p>I designed a palette system for Docs that accomodated the incoming features, and worked with design leads on the other editors to make sure we were consistent.</p>

                      <p>I gathered stats on the top 10% formatting actions on desktop and compared them to mobile.  I then designed a contextual tool strip that
                        appeared above the on-screen keyboard, making popular actions much faster to access.</p>
                      <p>The toolbar was particularly useful for surfacing secondary options like indentation when inside of a list.</p>
                      <p>After launch, documents containing rich formatting increased significantly.</p>

                      <p>Commenting was very powerful feature, but usage was dissapointlingly low. I suspected it was because discovery and access to the feature was buried.</p>
                      <p>I designed this feature which appeared near the margin when you hovered in that area, or selected content on the canvas.</p>
